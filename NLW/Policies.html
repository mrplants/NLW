<h2>Meal Tickets:</h2>

<h2>Sacred Heart Parish Center:</h2>
<p>You will not be the only guests at the Parish Center. It is a dormitory and active residence with long-term guests and visitors, so please be aware of this and be courteous. Since most rooms have only one key, you’ll need to make arrangements with your roommates to ensure that you are able to get back into your room when needed. The front desk is not like one at a hotel; they will not let you into your rooms if you are locked out. When you check out on Sunday morning, please strip your bed, place your linens and towels in the appropriate bins, and return your key to our representative. If a key is misplaced, you are liable for a $25 fee.</p>

<h2>Residence Halls:</h2>
<p>Please be respectful when visiting the residence halls. The residence halls at Notre Dame are segregated by gender. Males must leave female dorms and females must leave male dorms by midnight on Thursday night and by 0200 on Friday and Saturday nights.</p>

<h2>Alcohol Policy:</h2>
<p>You must be 21 to enter a bar in the state of Indiana, regardless of whether or not you intend to drink. The bars and police strictly enforce this law. You must be 21 to drive with alcohol in the car regardless if someone else is 21 in the car. <br>
No drinking if you are under 21. If you are 21 or over and choose to drink, do so responsibly.<br>
If you are 21 or over, there will be a Zero Tolerance policy for drinking and driving, meaning that if you have had one drink you cannot drive.<br>
No drinking in the ROTC building or any other building used by the conference on campus – this includes the lodging facility of the Sacred Heart Parish Center.</p>
<h3>If you are caught breaking any of these rules, your unit will be notified by an immediate phone call to the mobile number of your CO, XO, MOI, and AMOI, followed by immediate expulsion from the conference, which may necessitate travel home at your own expense.</h3>

<h2>Personal Safety:</h2>
<p>The area immediately around campus is not the safest place to walk after dark. In addition, many of the roads adjacent to campus do not have sidewalks. If you travel off campus, it’s best to take a cab both ways. Please do not attempt to walk off campus. Cab numbers are provided in the “Activities” section of this app.</p>

<h2>Parking:</h2>
<p>If you have a POV or government vehicle, you will not be able to park near the ROTC building on Thursday or Friday during business hours. Please park at Sacred Heart Parish Center and walk to the Pasquerilla Center. You will be able to park in the large lot adjacent to the Pasquerilla Center on evenings and weekends. If you decide to drive to Pasquerilla Center, please volunteer to drive other Midshipmen.</p>
